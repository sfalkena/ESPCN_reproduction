[2] [3] [4] However, in these methods the super-resolution (SR) operation is performed in high resolution (HR) space. According to the writers of the paper: *'this is sub-optimal and adds computation complexity'*. The goal is to find a more efficient method to upscale images. More specifically, the goal is to make this process fast enough so that it can be applied real-time to video material.\n","##Experiment setup as proposed by the authors\n","The authors of the paper propose a CNN architecture where the feature maps are extracted in low resolution (LR) space. Only at the very end of the network the resolution will be increased. The advantage of this network is two fold: \n","The computational complexity of the whole model is low.\n","Better and more complex SR operations are learned compared to other models.\n","\n","The proposed CNN architecture, called ESPCN, is shown below. As can be seen, the ESPCN consists of three convolutional layers, two normal convolutional layers and one sub-pixel convolutional layer which aggregates the feature maps from LR space and performs the SR operation. This last layer is called the sub-pixel convolution layer. In the first layer the Y channel of a YCrCb LR image is taken as the input and is convolved with a kernel size of 5x5 to 64 different output channels. After this, two convolutional layers are used with a kernel size of 3x3 which reduces the number of channels to the square of the scaling factor. The last layer shuffles the pixels to obtain the final SR image.\n","\n","![architecture](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1_XmEeASLK9a94dRA9y7wNdBqIMJC5SDQ)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"d3eLqRCaHT-r","colab_type":"text"},"source":["# Implementation of the code\n","The actual code is implemented from scratch in this notebook, where only the information given in the paper is used.

We refer to these small parts as patches in this reproduction. In order to reduce memory issues, it has been chosen to only save a list of names of the available patches per image, instead of the individual patches themselves. As can be seen in the code snippet below, the function `getPatchList` is searching for the available patches per image, while `PatchList_get` is saving the information of the former function into a list. During training time, the function `createPatch` is used to transform the entries of the list of available patches into real image patches. Finally, the bicubic upsampling function is used to load low resolution images and upsample them to high resolution images. Later, during visualisation, the luminance channel is substituted with the one upsampled by the model, while the Cr and Cb channels are kept. This makes that the images only trained on luminance can be displayed in color. Noticeably, multiple functions need to be called on the sets of images from different directories.

All hyperparameters are tuned independently  while keeping the other hyperparameters fixed during training sessions of 300 epochs. Results of the hyperparameter tuning can be seen in the separate notebook which can be found [here](https://github.com/sfalkena/ESPCN_reproduction/tree/master/_notebooks/Hyperparameter_tuning).

Furthermore, a strange behaviour is observed for a batch size of 4 (green line). At first, the loss decays normally, after which it suddenly explodes and decreases again.

The values 1e-6 and 1e-10 appear to give the best results, however the margin with the other values is small. Therefore, this slightly better result can be due to the randomness in the learning process (initialization of model, splitting training dataset into training and validation patches, batch generation).

First, let's discuss a couple of things that were unclear about the implementation:\n","## Unclarities\n","###The stopping criterion\n","In the paper, the authors define the stopping criterion as follows: The training stops after no improvement of the cost function is observed after 100 epochs. However, only this sentence can already be interpreted in two ways: Train for a minimum of 100 epochs and then stop when no improvement can be observed, or, train for a number of epochs, so that a window of 100 epochs falls within some threshold value. Moreover, the value of this threshold is not mentioned in the paper. As this would require another hyperparameter to tune, it has been chosen to train the network for a fixed number of epochs, so that the network trains within some time limit. No indication on the total number of epochs has been given in the paper, so it has been set to a value of 300 during most of the hyperparameter tuning. Within 300 epochs, the loss converges enough to see if a setting works well or not. For the final model, the amount of epochs was based on available time and has been chosen to be 5000 epochs\n","\n","### The learning rate\n","The paper mentions the following about the value of the learning rate: Initial learning rate is set to 0.01 and final learning rate is set to 0.0001 and updated gradually when the improvement of the cost function is smaller than a threshold µ. This has been implemented with the PyTorch method: ReduceLRonPlateau, which reduces the learning rate in a similar way as described in the paper. However, the value of µ has not been mentioned in the paper. During hyperparameter tuning, several values have been tried, leading to the conclusion that only large values of µ were not working very well.\n","\n","### The luminance channel\n","The paper states the following sentence: “For our final models, we use 50,000 randomly selected images from ImageNet [5] for the training. Following previous works, we only consider the luminance channel in YCbCr colour space in this section because humans are more sensitive to luminance changes” [6]. This sentence has been interpreted as that the model has been trained and evaluated on the luminance (Y) channel of the input images. This conclusion has been drawn by also looking at the model architecture where it seems that only one channel has been used as the input for the model. As the model also outputs the luminance channel, the choice has been made to also evaluate the model on the PSNR of two luminance images.\n","\n","## Discussion of our implementation:\n","The unclarities about the paper are not the only thing contributing to the fact that our results are different from the original paper. During the visualization of the test phase, it was noted that some of the output images contained white spots in dark areas and dark spots in light areas. We believe this is a great contributor to our apparently low PSNR. We have been trying to understand what causes this, but at the time of writing, have not succeeded in finding the cause.\n","\n","Furthermore, we found some inconsistencies in the used test data. The high resolution images of one folder appear to be slightly different than the high resolution images of another folder, while this should in fact be exactly the same images. Therefore, it can be the case that we have used slightly altered test images in comparison with the paper’s test images, resulting in lower PSNR values.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"zrorZpignvRC","colab_type":"text"},"source":["# To reproduce or not to reproduce?\n","The aim of this blogpost is to reproduce the results found in the “Real-Time Single Image and Video Super-Resolution Using an Efficient Sub-Pixel Convolutional Neural Network”. In order to do so, a pytorch implementation is written from scratch using only information from the paper itself. The paper presents a method for image super resolution which is fast enough so that it can be applied on real-time video material. This is done with a CNN architecture, consisting of three convolutional layers, where the feature maps are extracted on the luminance channel in low resolution space. After this, the resolution is increased only at the very end by an upsampling layer.\n","\n","At the beginning of the project the paper was easy to read for us being no experts in the field of deep learning. Diving into the process of reproducing the paper we discovered that some hyperparameters for training were not specified in the paper. Also, we encountered some other uncertainties related to the stopping criterion and the luminance channel. Apart from the appearance of black and white spots we believe the visual results of our reproduction attempt are considerably accurate.\n","\n","Although the performance of our reproduction is not as high as stated in the paper we believe that it is reproducible. As this was our first project in the field of deep learning we had no experience in finding the correct hyperparameters for training.
